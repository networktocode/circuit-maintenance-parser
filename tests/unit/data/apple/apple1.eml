There is no change required on your end as we will gracefully drain the traffic prior to maintenance.

When the maintenance is completed, Apple will automatically re-route traffic back.
For reference, our current max prefix setting recommendation is: IPv4 = 10000 and IPv6 = 1000.
Questions about this event can be sent to peering-noc@group.apple.com.

Thank you for peering with Apple!
